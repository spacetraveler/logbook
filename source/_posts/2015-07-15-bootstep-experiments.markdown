Earlier I introduced BootSteps as the visual element that SpaceTraveler leaves behind.
So far it only lived in a digital environment. In order to change that I explored a way to create a physical prototype.
Obviously, starting with a digital mock-up yet again.</br>

Create a blind, it will be used to shape the silicone mold.</br>
Always use a sharp scalpel when cutting stuff.</br>

Combine the blue with the white dough in equal shares. Do not eat.</br>
Knead until the color of the material is even. You have five minutes to bring it into your desired shape, then the silicone mold will stay as is.</br>

I decided on Ruby red cask resin for the final imprint.
Again, do not eat. Protective gloves are furthermore advisable.</br>

Mix two parts resin to one part of hardener.</br>
Stir with a wooden stick.</br>

Wait for eventual bubbles of trapped air to travel to the surface.</br>
Pour the mixture into your silicone mold. All done.</br>

Patiently wait for 24h.</br>
Voila. The hardened resin is ready to be released from the mold.</br>

While the finished piece features a fine shiny surface, the opposite side does not fulfill my expectations. It is rough and matt. Very DIY.</br>
Polishing might improve its appearance, but for now I will resort to good old photo filters. Digital magic.</br>
