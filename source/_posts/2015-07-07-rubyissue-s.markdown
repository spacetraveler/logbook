There's an issue with issues.
And it took me a while to stumble upon it, which is the issue itself: Finding issues.
More precisely, finding open source issues that are significant, compelling, bizarre, tricky and all together worthwhile the time to contribute.

Now, there's also an attempt to solve this issue with issues:[RubyIssue(s)](https://rubyissues.ongoodbits.com/). Some would say, it is a bi-monthly mailing, I would describe it as a guided space flight through a curated list of cracks within Ruby projects.

RubyIssue(s) is mostly a <i>solution in progress</i>, which means I absolutely welcome all fruitful collaborative efforts.
I'm curious to read every line of feedback send to this [inbox](mailto:base@spacetraveler.io) and would attempt a somersault in zero gravity for every Ruby issue that is pointed out to me.

If you would simply like to catch the next RubyIssue(s) that floats through this orbit, this is where you[subscribe](https://rubyissues.ongoodbits.com/).
