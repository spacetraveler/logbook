This space tells of a particular community that evolved from gravity, more precisely <i>Ruby Gravity</i>. According to the SpaceTravelerâ€™s Encyclopedia Ruby Gravity is defined as a natural phenomenon by which all those who affiliate with the Ruby programming language meet one another. Beware, it may result in spirited conversations, fruitful collaboration and sometimes genuine friendships.

The SpaceTraveler drifts through the well-known as well as peripheral edges of this community, to find essential and/ or creative applications of the language, while purposely leaving a visible trace.
