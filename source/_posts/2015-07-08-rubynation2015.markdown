Some giant leaps begin with one small step. Others begin with covering 6,706 km (i.e. 4166.92 miles), while sitting in a chair in the sky above the North Atlantic Ocean.

On June 7th 2015 the SpaceTraveler crew and I left our base in Berlin and headed for the US of A.
The crew was intrigued to meet the [Ruby user group in New York City](www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/) and attend [RubyNation](http://www.rubynation.org/) in Washington DC.
Switching continents plus time zones to mingle with the programmer community at a regional conference seems quite some trouble to take on. That's probably true.</br>

However, the mission of the SpaceTraveler is to explore and understand the ecosystem of the Ruby programming language – which we refer to as the *Ruby Orbit* – and share findings.
Meeting and getting to know different contributors, actors and visitors as well as investigating contemporary fields of interests, issues and questions is essential in this regard.

If you ask me about the success of this particular trip, I don't have a tool to measure that (just yet). What I do have are a growing number of strategies that indicate how to best approach the SpaceTraveler's mission. One of them I learned from philosopher, writer and designer John Thackara and his talk [How we meet is as important as why](http://www.doorsofperception.com/learning-institutions/presence-and-encounter-how-we-meet-is-as-important-as-why/). The following paragraph is taken from his write-up: </br>

"In his book I and Thou in 1923, the philosopher and theologian Martin Buber counseled that 'All knowledge is dialogic'  – but he did not just advocate talk. Community and connection are not just about words, he said;  they’re about encounter, and presence."

A thought that does not only justify, but strongly recommends we cross an ocean – or possibly an entire galaxy – in order to meet.
