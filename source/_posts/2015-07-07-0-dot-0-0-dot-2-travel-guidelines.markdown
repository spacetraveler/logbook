Kon’nichi wa and welcome from the Ruby Orbit.</br>
By the by, *thdwuuf is an Onomatopoeia – a written sound – that describes the noise any kind of boots creates when walking on sand.


Running through my mission checklist it says: Leave a visible trace!</br>
In this regard, you may have noticed the shiny red element greeting you at the top of my Logbook.
It resembles the imprint of my boots:

Neat, right?
The soles sport a pattern made from gemstones of different shapes and sizes – proper RubyBoots!</br>
Wherever Ruby gravity takes me, these prints will be left in space. In this way you are able to track my projects or undertakings and instantly know they are part of this SpaceTraveler Mission.

Why bootsteps? I was inspired by the following historic event: </br>
the Apollo 11 spaceflight. More precisely the trace Neil Armstrong left behind on the Moon on July 21 at 02:56 UTC.

Following I'm going to take you on a visual stroll throught the early development of this visual element as well as its iterations.
