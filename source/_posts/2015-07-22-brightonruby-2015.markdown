Spacetraveler's Robin and Sonja are expected to return to base later this evening â€“ after crossing a substantially shorter distance this time around.</br>
Nevertheless, lounging with the mostly British Ruby community in Brighton was highly animating and had some extra thrill in store.

On a sidenote, I wish I had known that we would be moving that much closer towards the sun. Contrary to all expectations, packing sunscreen for UK travels is advisable. 20+ at least.

Apart from sizzling rays of sun, it was host Andy Croll's positive energy that ignited BrightonRuby's incredibly welcoming atmosphere. Thus, I was pleasantly excited to give a short and sweet Lightning talk about [RubyIssue(s)](http://logbook.spacetraveler.io/logbook/2015/07/16/rubyissue-s/) on stage.

Standing in line for microphone and spotlight amongst wonderful fellow speakers is a remarkable and equally humbling experience.
Amongst others, [Tatiana Soukiassian](https://twitter.com/binaryberry) made an engaging case for the importance to create a fruitful work environment for Junior Developers. [Rob Miller's](https://twitter.com/robmil) stage debut on the topic of small data munging burst with all kinds of British smartness.</br>
Asking the question why a majority of women leave 'tech' work environments provides a different perspective on this particular diversity issue. [Kinsey Durham](https://twitter.com/KinseyAnnDurham) investigated exactly that question and shared her findings.</br>
Lastly, [Avdi Grimm](https://twitter.com/avdi) maneuvered the audience through an intriguing,  somewhat challenging body of thought and carved out a potential future outlook for the Ruby language.
